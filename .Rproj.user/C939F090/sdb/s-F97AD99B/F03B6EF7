Also, the package provide a Shiny App to ease the work.\nThe interface is also available at http://sdrinterface.shinyapps.io/shiny to make the interface without R installed in our systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe package is available on CRAN, so it could be installed as another package available on CRAN, simple typing:\n```R\ninstall.packages(\"SDR\")\n```\n\nYou can install the package using the function `install_github()` provided by the `devtools` package:  \n\n```R\ndevtools::install_github(\"aklxao2/SDR\")\n```\n\n## Usage and examples\n\nThe package provide a web interface to ease the work, this intarface could be accesed by:\n* visiting http://sdrinterface.shinyapps.io/shiny\n* calling the function to launch the interface in a local server.  \nTo create the local server you can simply call the function `SDR_GUI()` of our package:  \n```R\nlibrary(\"SDR\")\nSDR_GUI()\n```\n\nThis will launch the interface in our predetermined browser. \n\nAlso the package can handle with _KEEL_ datasets to use within the subgroups discovery algorithms in order to use it in a R script for example. \nThose functions could change the target variable used by the algorithms, and also modify the fuzzy sets definitions created. For example, having the file `iris.dat` in our working directory:\n```R\nirisKEEL <- read.keel(\"iris.dat\")\nirisKEEL <- modifyFuzzyCrispIntervals(irisKEEL, 6) #Use 6 fuzzy labels \n#With classic iris dataset we cannot change the target variable, we need a categorical one. So, this function throws an error with this dataset\nirisKEEL <- changeTargetVariable(irisKEEL, 3) #Use variable at position 3 as target variable.\n```\n\nThe are three subgroup discovery implemented: __SDIGA__, __MESDIF__ and __NMEEF-SD__ You can use this algorithms by:\n* specifying the path of a parameter file \n* specifying all the parameters of the algorithm in the function call, one by one.  \n\nThe former is normally used with datasets prepared to make an execution directly, because this way does not allow to change the structure of the datasets and set other target variable, this target variable is the last variable defined in the dataset.\nThe latter is for dataset that we loaded in R and make some modifications.\n\nHaving a parameters file for MESDIF, for example, in our working directory called `paramFile.txt`:\n```R\nMESDIF(\"paramFile.txt\")\n``` \nFor more information and examples about the use of the algorithms and subgroup discovery, please, refer to the documentation.\n",
